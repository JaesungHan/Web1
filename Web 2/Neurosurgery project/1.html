        <li>UABD</li>
          <p>UABD is done like this. A laminectomy is a surgical procedure that
             removes a portion of the vertebral bone called the lamina, which is
             the roof of the spinal canal. It is a major spine operation with residual
             scar tissue and may result in postlaminectomy syndrome. Depending on the
             problem, smaller alternatives, e.g., small endoscopic procedures, without bone removal, may be possible.</p>

            <p>A discectomy (also called open discectomy, if done through a 1/2 inch or larger skin opening) is the surgical removal of abnormal disc material that presses on a nerve root or the spinal cord. The procedure involves removing a portion of an intervertebral disc, which causes pain, weakness or numbness by stressing the spinal cord or radiating nerves. The traditional open discectomy, or Love's technique, was published by Ross and Love in 1971. Advances have produced visualization improvements to traditional discectomy procedures (e.g. microdiscectomy, an open discectomy using an external microscope typically done through a 1 inch or larger skin opening), or endoscopic discectomy (the scope passes internally and typically done through a 2 mm skin opening or larger, up to 12 mm).
